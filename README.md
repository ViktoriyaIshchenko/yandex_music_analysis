# Yandex Music Analysis

This project analyzes user data from Yandex Music to compare behavior and preferences in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The study involves hypothesis testing to explore patterns in user activity and genre popularity.

## Project Goals

1. Determine if user activity depends on the day of the week and whether this varies between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
2. Identify differences in genre preferences between Moscow and Saint Petersburg during specific time periods (Monday mornings and Friday evenings).
3. Compare overall genre preferences in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
